# Washify - Car Wash Booking Management

Washify is a full-stack web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing car wash bookings. Users can create, view, update, delete, search, and filter bookings seamlessly.
This project was developed as a MERN stack assessment, focusing on core CRUD functionalities, RESTful API design, and a clean user experience.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **CRUD Operations:** Full capabilities to Create, Read, Update, and Delete car wash bookings.
- **View All Bookings:** The homepage displays all bookings in a responsive card layout with pagination (8â€“10 bookings per page).
- **Detailed Booking View:** Each booking has a dedicated page showing all its details.
- **Create & Edit Bookings:** User-friendly forms for adding new bookings and editing existing ones. The edit form comes pre-populated with the existing data.
- **Delete Confirmation:** A confirmation modal appears before deleting a booking to prevent accidental data loss.

### Search and Filtering
- **Real-time Search:** Instantly search for bookings by Customer Name or Car Details (Make, Model).
- **Advanced Filtering:** Filter bookings based on multiple criteria:
  - Service Type (e.g., Basic Wash, Deluxe Wash)
  - Car Type (e.g., Sedan, SUV)
  - Booking Status (e.g., Pending, Confirmed, Completed)
  - Date Range

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design:** The UI is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Loading & Error States:** Clear loading indicators and error messages are displayed during API calls to provide feedback to the user.
- **Clean & Modern UI:** A simple and intuitive interface for a smooth user experience.
